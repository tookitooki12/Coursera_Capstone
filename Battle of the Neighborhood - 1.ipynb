    "\n",
    "Dubai is a renowned city for the wealthy. It is a popular destination for travelers on business as well as leisure. The city with it's central location and warm climate on top of it's capital flow presents a great opportunity for restaurants and hotel businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore FourSquare API data to determine where a new hotel/restaurant business would succeed in Dubai. Our business will need to be based in close proximity to nearby major Airports and be near high-rent areas that offer a demographic of individuals most likely to have disposable income to spend on eating out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The venue will also need to be in a neighborhood that is commercially active but not flooding with competition. \n",
